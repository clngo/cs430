Question 1: First, Lisp was strong at rapid development to
write software quickly. This made them create new features
faster than their competitors; giving them the advantage or
reacting fast enough against new features.

Secondly, Lisp was a very high-level language and capable of
creating features other software could not. This meant that
costs would be low and did not demand a big development
team, resulting in better profit and lower risks.

As Lisp was not well-known in the business and there was a
lack of information about the business on what langauge they
were running.

Question 2: Graham believes progrmaming languages vary in
power; not all high-level languages are equal. Therefore,
there are more powerful languages that help programmers more
efficiently. However, some may not use powerful languages as
in the Blub paradox, having mastery in one langauge may
hinder learning new languages.

Question 3: What is the design of the language intended for?
What does the community think about the language? How does
the language compare to other existing languages
